              Hello! My name is Meghan. I'm a full stack developer based in the
              San Francisco Bay Area. My passion is delivering engaging,
              memorable, and meaningful user experiences. Thriving in the front
              end, I enjoy working at the intersection of art and functionality.
              Although I'm actively seeking new opportunities, I'm currently
              developing the front end at&nbsp;

              When I get a break from coding, you can often find me practicing
              the harp, piano, or guitar, or spending time with my cats, Ajax
              and Ikaros. üêà
